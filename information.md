# DC Voltage Drop

### Description
A DC Voltage Drop Calculator helps determine the amount of voltage loss in a direct current (DC) electrical circuit over a given wire length. By inputting variables such as conductor material, wire size, current, and distance, this tool provides an accurate estimate of voltage drop, ensuring optimal performance and safety in electrical installations.

### Assumptions
Constant Current Load: It is assumed that the current in the circuit is constant throughout the wire and does not vary over time.

Uniform Conductor Material: The calculator assumes that the conductor is made of copper with consistent resistivity. Resistivity values are referenced from: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/copper-wire-d_1429.html

Standard Temperature: The calculation often assumes the wire operates at a standard ambient temperature of 25 degrees C.

DC Only (No AC Effects): The calculator does not account for alternating current (AC) effects such as inductance, capacitance, or skin effect. Only pure DC voltage drop is considered.

Steady-State Condition: It assumes that the circuit is operating in a steady state without any transient or startup effects.

Perfect Connections: The calculator assumes that there is no additional resistance introduced by imperfect connections, terminals, or joints.

Neglecting Voltage Rise: Any potential voltage rise due to back electromotive force (EMF) or other factors is ignored.

Wire Length Is Accurate: It is assumed that the length inputted is the actual length of the wire carrying the current (not just the physical distance, which could be shorter due to routing).

### Instructions
1. Enter the DC Voltage:
Provide the voltage of your power source. Make sure it matches the rating of the power supply you are using.

2. Enter the Current Draw:
Input the current that the circuit will draw. Check the specifications of your load or use an ammeter to measure this value.

3. Select or Input Wire Size:
Choose the correct wire gauge from the list or input the wire size based on your design. Larger wires (lower gauge numbers) have less resistance and lead to lower voltage drops.

4. Input the Wire Length:
Measure the one-way distance from the power source to the load and input this value. Ensure accuracy in this measurement, as the wire length significantly affects the voltage drop.
